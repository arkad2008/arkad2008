![Duver Arredondo — Data/UX Analytics](./banner.svg)


# Hi, I'm Duver 👋

**Data / UX Analytics** with a **GIS** background (Forest Engineer) and **20+ years** solving complex problems. I recently completed the **TripleTen Data Analytics bootcamp** and turn user & operational data into **actionable insights** that improve **journeys, KPIs, and efficiency**.

- 🔬 Projects: funnels & **A/B testing**, **cohorts/retention** and churn, call-center **operational KPIs**, e-commerce analytics, mobility/taxi analysis.
- 🛠️ Tools: **Python** (pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn), **SQL**, **Power BI**, **Excel**.
- ✅ Data quality & ETL: validation, consistency, traceability; **basic ETL** (Extract-Transform-Load).
- 🧭 Leadership: served as **Acting Team Coordinator** and **Acting Territorial Director** (standards, change control, executive reporting).
- 🤖 Curious about **AI-assisted workflows** to speed up analysis and QA.
